    This is one question we decided to remove from the final exam
    but I still do like it because it challenges people.
    How to make a connection between known algorithms
    and the following code. To your opinion, the following
    code is closed to:

    * `Djiksta's algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>`_
    * `Eratosthenes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes>`_
    * `Binary search algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm>`_

        import math

        def meslogs_jusque(N):
            memolog = { 1:0.0 }
            for i in range(2,N+1):
                if i in memolog:
                    pass
                else:
                    l = math.log(i)
                    total = i
                    for j in range(total, N+1, total):
                        memolog[j] = memolog.get(j, 0.0) + l
                    total *= i
                    while total < N+1:
                        for j in range(total, N+1, total):
                            memolog[j] += l
                        total *= i
            return memolog
